Hello, world! Welcome to the blog of the spring 2015 Software Design class at The Blake School in Minneapolis, MN. Our course is a semester-long upper level computer science elective that is largely student-led. By "student-led," we mean that students co-construct the curriculum so that they learn the skills of designing and building software that solves real-world problems. In light of this, we will be connecting with a community organization in the Twin Cities area who we will partner with to build some real software for the public.

As we go through the semester, we will regularly update this blog to reflect our processes of how we're learning to design and engineer software. Featured posts will appear on the front page feed and each author's complete collection of posts will be accesible on their author page (linked on the left side of the front page). Check back soon for further updates and/or feel free to follow our rss feed (linked in the page footer). Here's to a great semester!
