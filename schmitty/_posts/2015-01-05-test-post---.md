Just in case you didn't know, we are using Markdown in class, a really cool compressed version of html that makes formatting things like this blog post **a lot** easier!

You can do so much, but knowing how to do it can be hard. I'm going to make a quick blog post for people who want to get crackin on updating their blog. I can't spoil all of the mystery for you yet, so I'm just going to include some md shortcuts. 

### Headings!

+ A Heading on your blog post gives it an air of importance and pomp. 

..* Some different heading sizes:

# Heading 

##Heading

###Heading

####Heading 

##### Heading  

+ To make something a heading, you just put a "#" sing before it in your code. For example, The largest heading size  is "# Heading"

### Links!

+ If you want to link to something, the quickest way is to write the text [in brackets] followed by (the link in pharanthesis)

+ [For example][glitchy]

### Pictures! 

+ You can also add pictures, kind of like this.

+ You start with an "!", followed by alternative text in [in brackets], and the link (in pharenthesies)


### Blockquotes!

> I honestly just think that this looks really cool, and makes everything I write seem fancy

+ To blockquote text, precede it with an ">". 

### Youtube Videos

+ Once again, not really sure when we would need this. The video is cool, so why not?

alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>


+ To insert a video, use this template 

> Put this 
> "href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE" target="_blank"" 
> Inside link brackets. 
> "src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10"" 
> This should go in Image brackets inside the link brackets.
